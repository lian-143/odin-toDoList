# Todo List App

A simple web application to organize and track tasks by project.

## Basic Functionality

- Create, view, and delete projects
- Add and remove tasks with a title, due date, and priority level
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Automatically save and load data using the Web Storage API (`localStorage`)

## What I Learned
- Separating core app logic from DOM manipulation for cleaner code
- Using `localStorage` with JSON to persist data between sessions
- Handling user events and dynamically updating the UI
